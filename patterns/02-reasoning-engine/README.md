# 02. The Reasoning Engine Pattern

**The core principle of the Reasoning Engine pattern is to create an AI system that moves beyond simple document retrieval to synthesize information from multiple sources, providing direct, actionable answers to complex business questions.**

### The Problem

Many expensive "AI" knowledge systems are just fancy search bars. They retrieve a list of documents, forcing users to still do the hard work of finding the actual answer. This delivers a low return on investment and fails to solve the core business problem: getting timely, accurate insights from a sea of data.

### Real-World Consequences: The High Cost of Manual Synthesis

- **Case Study: JPMorgan Chase's Contract Intelligence (COiN)**

  - **The Incident:** Legal and financial teams were required to manually review and interpret thousands of complex commercial loan agreements. This repetitive, labor-intensive process consumed over **360,000 work-hours annually** and was prone to costly human error in compliance.
  - **The Impact:** The COiN platform was developed to act as a reasoning engine, using AI to analyze and extract critical data from 12,000 documents in mere secondsâ€”a task that previously took weeks. This automation saves the firm hundreds of thousands of hours per year, reduces compliance risk, and allows employees to focus on higher-value strategic work.

- **Case Study: JPMorgan Chase's Emerging Opportunities Engine**
  - **The Incident:** To identify clients for new equity offerings, investment bankers had to manually sift through vast amounts of client data and market signals. The process was slow, inconsistent, and risked missing key opportunities.
  - **The Impact:** The bank built an AI-powered reasoning engine that synthesizes historical client behavior and market data to identify and rank the best-matched clients for new deals. The system delivers direct, actionable recommendations, helping bankers close deals and secure new business much more efficiently.

### The Architectural Solution

Instead of just retrieving documents, we build a system with a **Reasoning Engine** at its core. This engine takes a user's business question, queries multiple data silos (documents, databases, APIs), and then synthesizes the findings into a single, direct, and actionable answer. It moves the cognitive load from the user to the system.
