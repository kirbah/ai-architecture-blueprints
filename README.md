# AI Architecture Blueprints

A collection of practical design patterns and blueprints for building safe, robust, and production-ready Generative AI systems. This repository is a resource for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and architects who are responsible for implementing AI that delivers business value without introducing unacceptable risk.

Unlike code-focused repositories, this collection emphasizes the architectural principles and guardrails needed to transform "black box" models into predictable, enterprise-grade assets.

## The Patterns

This is a living document. New patterns will be added over time.

- **[01. The Safety Guardrail Pattern](./patterns/01-safety-guardrails/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** Unconstrained LLMs can accept malicious prompts and generate harmful, inaccurate, or brand-damaging content.
  - **Solution:** Implement a framework of input sanitization and output validation to act as a firewall between the user and the model.

- **[02. The Reasoning Engine Pattern](./patterns/02-reasoning-engine/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** Standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems often return lists of documents, not direct answers, forcing users to do the hard work of synthesis.
  - **Solution:** Architect a system that synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide a single, actionable answer to a user's query.

- **[03. The Human-in-the-Loop Pattern](./patterns/03-human-in-the-loop/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** Fully automated systems can fail catastrophically when an AI makes a decision at machine speed without human oversight.
  - **Solution:** Design a system where an AI makes recommendations, but a human expert provides the final approval for critical actions.

- **[04. The Planning Pattern](./patterns/04-planning/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** Simple AI agents fail at complex tasks because they can't create and follow a multi-step plan.
  - **Solution:** Implement a planning module that allows the AI to decompose a high-level goal into a sequence of executable steps.

- **[05. The Learning & Adaptation Pattern](./patterns/05-learning-and-adaptation/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** Static AI systems can't improve over time and become obsolete as the real world changes.
  - **Solution:** Design a feedback loop that allows the AI to learn from its successes and failures, continuously adapting and improving its performance.

- **[06. The Evaluation and Monitoring Pattern](./patterns/06-evaluation-and-monitoring/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** AI systems can fail silently, degrade over time, or incur runaway costs without a proper monitoring framework.
  - **Solution:** Implement a continuous measurement system to track performance, risk, and cost, providing the visibility needed to govern the AI in production.
