---

A collection of practical design patterns and blueprints for building safe, robust, and production-ready Generative AI systems. This repository is a resource for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and architects who are responsible for implementing AI that delivers business value without introducing unacceptable risk.

Unlike code-focused repositories, this collection emphasizes the architectural principles and guardrails needed to transform "black box" models into predictable, enterprise-grade assets.

### Vision & Roadmap

This is a living project. The architectural challenges of enterprise AI are constantly evolving, and so is this repository. Future blueprints on our roadmap include:

- **The Legacy Adapter Pattern:** Strategies for safely connecting modern AI to brittle, legacy systems.
- **The Hybrid Team Workflow Pattern:** A framework for managing the friction between agile engineering teams and exploratory data science teams.
- **The Cost Governance Pattern:** Architectures for monitoring, alerting, and controlling the financial spend of production AI systems.
