# How to Contribute

Thank you for your interest in improving the AI Architecture Blueprints.

While I am the primary author, I welcome feedback and suggestions from the community. The best way to contribute is by opening a GitHub Issue to:

- Suggest a new pattern.
- Propose a better real-world case study for an existing pattern.
- Point out any errors or areas that are unclear.

Your real-world experience is invaluable, and I look forward to the discussion.
