# AI Architecture Blueprints

A collection of practical design patterns and blueprints for building safe, robust, and production-ready Generative AI systems. This repository is a resource for CTOs, VPs of Engineering, and architects who are responsible for implementing AI that delivers business value without introducing unacceptable risk.

Unlike code-focused repositories, this collection emphasizes the architectural principles and guardrails needed to transform "black box" models into predictable, enterprise-grade assets.

## Who This Is For

This repository is for the CTO, VP of Engineering, or senior architect responsible for turning AI hype into enterprise-grade reality. You are in the right place if you care more about **scalability, security, and ROI** than the latest theoretical model. Our goal is to address the **hard parts** of building and deploying AI on top of complex, existing infrastructure.

### Where to Start?

Not sure where to begin? Start with the pattern that addresses your most urgent pain point:

- **If your primary concern is risk and brand safety...**
  - Start with **[Pattern #1: The Safety Guardrail](./01-safety-guardrails/README.md)**.
- **If you need to show ROI from your data on a tight budget...**
  - Start with **[Pattern #2: The Reasoning Engine](./02-reasoning-engine/README.md)**.
- **If you are building autonomous agents that take action...**
  - Start with **[Pattern #7: The Goal and Monitoring Pattern](./07-goal-and-monitoring/README.md)**.
- **If you are integrating AI with legacy systems...**
  - Start with **[Pattern #8: The Resilient Workflow](./08-the-resilient-workflow-pattern/README.md)**.

### Vision & Roadmap

This is a living project. The architectural challenges of enterprise AI are constantly evolving, and so is this repository. Future blueprints on our roadmap include:

- **The Legacy Adapter Pattern:** Strategies for safely connecting modern AI to brittle, legacy systems.
- **The Hybrid Team Workflow Pattern:** A framework for managing the friction between agile engineering teams and exploratory data science teams.
- **The Cost Governance Pattern:** Architectures for monitoring, alerting, and controlling the financial spend of production AI systems.
