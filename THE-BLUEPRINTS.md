# The AI Architecture Blueprints

This collection is for the CTO, VP of Engineering, or senior architect responsible for turning AI hype into enterprise-grade reality. The blueprints focus on the hard parts of building and deploying AI that is scalable, secure, and delivers real business value.

This is a living document. New patterns will be added over time.

- **[01. The Safety Guardrail Pattern](./patterns/01-safety-guardrails/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** Unconstrained LLMs can accept malicious prompts and generate harmful, inaccurate, or brand-damaging content.
  - **Solution:** Implement a framework of input sanitization and output validation to act as a firewall between the user and the model.

- **[02. The Reasoning Engine Pattern](./patterns/02-reasoning-engine/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** Standard RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems often return lists of documents, not direct answers, forcing users to do the hard work of synthesis.
  - **Solution:** Architect a system that synthesizes information from multiple sources to provide a single, actionable answer to a user's query.

- **[03. The Human-in-the-Loop Pattern](./patterns/03-human-in-the-loop/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** Fully automated systems can fail catastrophically when an AI makes a decision at machine speed without human oversight.
  - **Solution:** Design a system where an AI makes recommendations, but a human expert provides the final approval for critical actions.

- **[04. The Planning Pattern](./patterns/04-the-planning-pattern/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** Simple, single-shot AI agents are excellent at specific, contained tasks, but fail when faced with complex business objectives.
  - **Solution:** Architect a system where an AI first decomposes a complex, high-level goal into a sequence of executable steps, transforming an unpredictable, black-box process into a transparent, auditable, and reliable workflow.

- **[05. The Learning & Adaptation Pattern](./patterns/05-learning-and-adaptation/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** Static AI systems can't improve over time and become obsolete as the real world changes.
  - **Solution:** Design a feedback loop that allows the AI to learn from its successes and failures, continuously adapting and improving its performance.

- **[06. The AI Observability Pattern](./patterns/06-ai-observability/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** An unobserved AI is a "black box" that can silently degrade, burn budget, and create compliance risks.
  - **Solution:** Architect an observability system to provide a real-time "control panel" for the AI's operational health, cost, and behavior.

- **[07. The Goal and Monitoring Pattern](./patterns/07-goal-and-monitoring/README.md)**

  - **Problem:** Automated systems without a clear definition of success and a mechanism to monitor progress are "fire-and-forget" liabilities.
  - **Solution:** Architect an AI system that can autonomously pursue a high-level objective by continuously tracking its own progress against predefined success criteria and adapting its actions to ensure the goal is achieved.

- **[08. The Resilient Workflow Pattern](./patterns/08-the-resilient-workflow-pattern/README.md)**
  - **Problem:** Brittle automation ("glass cannons") crashes on predictable errors like API timeouts, causing operational downtime and eroding user trust.
  - **Solution:** Design a dedicated Resilience Layer that decouples the AI agent's core logic from the complexities of error handling.
